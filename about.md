## üëã Hello

Hi! I'm Alicia Garnier, almost a Computer Scientist (currently studying at UNIFAL) and a Junior Software Engineer at iFood.  
I‚Äôm passionate about technology, learning, and turning ideas into real, working systems.  

## About Me

I‚Äôm a curious and resilient person, always eager to learn and explore new things. I value autonomy in my work and I love diving deep into subjects until I truly understand them.  

Outside of tech, I enjoy drinking coffee (a lot!), reading books, writing, and having good conversations.  

My dream is to share what I learn and use my knowledge to help and inspire others ‚Äî contributing not just to the tech world, but to people‚Äôs growth too.

## Professional Experience

I started my career at Cielo, working as a Software Engineer on microservices and event-driven architectures.  At the time, I was only in my fourth semester of Computer Science, but that experience opened my eyes to how much I love building things that work at scale.

While I‚Äôve always been fascinated by data and machine learning, that first experience taught me that what I truly enjoy is productizing systems ‚Äî from development to infrastructure ‚Äî making everything run smoothly in production.

That‚Äôs how I discovered my passion for MLOps: it‚Äôs like DevOps, but focused on bringing Machine Learning models into the real world.  And now, that‚Äôs the area that truly captivates me.

### Current Role

Today, I work as a Software Engineer at iFood, one of the largest tech companies in Brazil and the leading food delivery platform in Latin America.  

I‚Äôm part of the ML Platform team, where we build solutions that bring to life many of the machine learning models used across iFood ‚Äî from recommendations to logistics optimization and customer experience.  

In the book ‚ÄúDesigning Machine Learning Systems‚Äù by Chip Huyen, she emphasizes the difference between academic ML models and production-grade ML systems used in real companies.  
For example, some models must run with very low latency. How do you make that possible?  

That‚Äôs exactly the kind of challenge that belongs to the MLOps world ‚Äî the intersection between machine learning, software engineering, and infrastructure.  

## Current Focus

At the moment, I‚Äôm focused on deepening my understanding of AI Engineering, studying topics like:  
- Agents  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Prompt Engineering  
- Infrastructure for ML systems  

I love experimenting with new tools and frameworks that bridge software engineering and machine learning.

## Fun Facts

- I‚Äôm obsessed with coffee ‚Äî we could easily spend hours talking about it.  
- I share my space with two lovely cats: Rogerinho and Menininha, who often join me while I code.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy exploring my projects ‚Äî and maybe share a cup of coffee with me (virtually ‚òï).
